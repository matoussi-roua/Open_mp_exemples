# Open_mp_exemples
This project aims to explore the use of OpenMP for parallel programming through three labs that progressively introduce OpenMP's features. Each lab focuses on a different concept, such as handling variables with OpenMP directives, using reduction to optimize performance, and efficiently calculating prime numbers in parallel.
